# Learning Windows Forms

Sample projects for learning about Windows Forms (WinForms).

## Sample

Code based Windows Forms creation.

## Designer

Using the code generated by the designer.

## Form Lifecycle

- Load and Shown
- Activated and Deactivated
- Closing and Closed

### Load and Shown

Load fires just before the Form is loaded.

Shown is fired after the form is shown or displayed.

The Load event is commonly used to populate the data shown in controls

### Activated and Deactivated

Activated fires when form gains focus and Deactivated fires when it loses focus.

### Closing and Closed

Closing fires just before the form is closed and Closed fires after the form is closed.

## Custom Dialogs

1. Create a form 
2. Set form properties to add dialog look, feel and behavior

- Set FormBorderStyle to FixedDialog
- Set ControlBox property to false
- Set AcceptButton and CancelButton button properties

3. Set dialog return value on button clicks

Setting the DialogResult property closes the dialog

## Menus

- MenuStrip and ToolStripMenuItem controls
- Designer supports inline editing
- Key ToolStripMenuItem properties

Text

- Can prefix/preface(?) one character with ampersand (&)
- Makes this the quick key
- Can open/select item using alt key

Image

- Get images from [Visual Studio Image Library](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35825)
- As of Visual Studio 2012 the images are a separate download

ShortCutKeys

Common shortcut and quick key combinations

```
New		Ctrl + N	Alt + N 
Open	Ctrl + O	Alt + O
Save	Ctrl + S	Alt + S
Save As				Alt + S
Print	Ctrl + P	Alt + P
Undo	Ctrl + Z	Alt + U
Redo	Ctrl + Y	Alt + R
Cut		Ctrl + X	Alt + T
Copy	Ctrl + C	Alt + C
Paste	Ctrl + V	Alt + P
```

## Toolbars

- ToolStrip control
- Can contain several several types of items
- Button, Label, TexBox, ComboBox, ProgressBar
- Controls on toolstrip are wrappers around common controls
- Example ToolStripComboBox is a wrapper around a ComboBox
- Tool strip controls surface many of properties/events of the wrapped control, but not all
- Can get access to the wrapped control

## Ribbon

Windows Forms do not include Ribbon controls

Windows Ribbon for WinForms 

- [RibbonWinForms](https://github.com/RibbonWinForms/RibbonWinForms) - opensource

Third-party

- Syncfusion [Microsoft Office-inspired WinForms Ribbon control](https://www.syncfusion.com/winforms-ui-controls/ribbon)
- Progress Telerik UI for WinForms [RibbonBar](https://www.telerik.com/products/winforms/ribbonbar.aspx)
- DevExpress [The Ribbon UI](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/118333/Controls-and-Libraries/Ribbon-Bars-and-Menu/Ribbon/The-Ribbon-UI)
- many others

## UserControls

- Composite control - a control made up of other controls
- Building a user control is similar to building a form
- Enables consolidation of common UI
- Can only be used in the project where it is defined

## Application Layouts

### MDI Applications

Main Form

- Set IsMdiContainer to True
- Use ActiveMdiChild to get reference to active child form
- Use MdiChildren to get collection of child forms
- Use LayoutMdi to arrange child forms

Child Forms

- Set MdiParent to main form on creation
- Use MdiParent to get a reference back to the main form
